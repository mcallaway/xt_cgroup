Back porting xt_cgroup to the Ubuntu Precise kernel.

This is confusing.

Started out with this:

netfilter: xtables: lightweight process control group matching
http://lwn.net/Articles/569678/
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/280690/

But those refer to a cgroup by "fwid" and the use of a net_filter cgroup extension. But that's not what
we ended up with. We had a net_cls cgroup extension.

I started with that patch, applied it once, then ran a diff -ruN on the source to get a clean patch.
I removed the uapi directory in the path to the source.

Also, there is an iptables patch for the xt_cgroup frontend. This is built separately.
See our iptables git repo for this build of the user space tools.

Ensure we're running the right kernel as our target host,
in this case the kernel on data-xfer-i2 (i2dp).

  root@data-xfer-i2:~# uname -r
  3.2.0-67-generic

So in our build environment set it up:

apt-get install linux-image-3.2.0-67-generic=3.2.0-67.101

from this git repository's dir:

sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$( uname -r )

apt-get source linux-source-3.2.0
cd linux-3.2.0/
patch -p1 < ../xt_cgroup.patch
cp /usr/src/linux-headers-$( uname -r )/Module.symvers .

make oldconfig # Press 'm': "control group" match support (NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_CGROUP) [N/m/?] (NEW) m
               # Answer No for the rest of the new stuff.
make prepare
make modules_prepare
make M=net/netfilter xt_cgroup.ko

sudo cp ./net/netfilter/xt_cgroup.ko /lib/modules/3.2.0-67-generic/extra/
sudo depmod
sudo modprobe xt_cgroup

cd ..
dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -b
